                'I was a co-founding data scientist of the EnvDesign model, a system (patent pending) that uses graph theory and optimization algorithms to design pre-production testing environments for Azure internal programs (an NP-hard problem). It is used in AzQualify, a pre-production testing/regression prevention system in Azure that catches ~5-10 regressions a month. Received a Microsoft Patent Cube Award after filing a patent for the EnvDesign Model.',
                'I was a co-founding data scientist of an open-source Python library, optimizn, that helps users customize optimization algorithms (simulated annealing, branch & bound) and the multi-arm bandit reinforcement learning algorithm for their problems/use cases.',
                'I wrote two papers (as first-name author) describing the EnvDesign model and the optimizn library. I co-authored a blog with Mark Russinovich, CTO of Azure, about how the optimizn library is used in Azure. I also presented both the EnvDesign model and optimizn library at Microsoft-internal poster galleries for ML, AI, and data science. See the Publications section of this website for links to the papers and blog.',

I presented both libraries at a company-internal poster gallery for ML, AI, data science, and gaming.'
